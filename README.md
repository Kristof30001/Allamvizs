DATAPACKAGE: HOUSEHOLD DATA
===========================================================================



by Open Power System Data: http://www.open-power-system-data.org/

Package Version: 2020-04-15

Detailed household load and solar generation in minutely to hourly
resolution

This data package contains measured time series data for several small
businesses and residential households relevant for household- or
low-voltage-level power system modeling. The data includes solar power
generation as well as electricity consumption (load) in a resolution up to
single device consumption. The starting point for the time series, as well
as data quality, varies between households, with gaps spanning from a few
minutes to entire days. All measurement devices provided cumulative energy
consumption/generation over time. Hence overall energy
consumption/generation is retained, in case of data gaps due to
communication problems. Measurements were conducted 1-minute intervals,
with all data made available in an interpolated, uniform and regular time
interval. All data gaps are either interpolated linearly, or filled with
data of prior days. Additionally, data in 15 and 60-minute resolution is
provided for compatibility with other time series data. Data processing is
conducted in Jupyter Notebooks/Python/pandas.

The data package covers the geographical region of 11 households in southern Germany.

We follow the Data Package standard by the Frictionless Data project, a
part of the Open Knowledge Foundation: http://frictionlessdata.io/
